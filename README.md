This is a chrome extension to automate the procedure of keyword extraction in research papers available as pdfs. 
The extension has been made using the PDF.js, a community driven open source project of Mozilla,and using IBM watson's 
cognitive capabilities to get the keywords. This project is a pure assembly of the two.
